# Ada83 Compiler

Single-file Ada 83 (ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A) compiler with an LLVM backend.

The compiler is one C file that builds with nothing but a C compiler. It
emits textual LLVM IR by default, and with `--native` it finishes the whole
pipeline itself — parse, optimize, lower to a host object, link — through a
copy of libLLVM it locates and loads **at run time**. LLVM is never a
build-time dependency.

## Building

```sh
make
```

That needs only:

- **`gcc`** or **`clang`** (`make CC=clang`) — the compiler is a single C
  file built with `-O3 -march=native -lm -lpthread`.
- **GNU `make`**.
- A 64-bit host with `__int128` support (x86-64 or AArch64).

On Linux, `make` also provisions the system libLLVM used by `--native`
if it is missing (probing `apt`, `dnf`, `pacman`, `zypper`, `apk`). This
step failing is fine — the compiler builds and works without LLVM; only
`--native` needs it, and it prints an actionable hint when the library
is absent. On Windows (MSYS2), `make` instead embeds the vendored
libLLVM from `tools/win64/` — see the platform notes.

## Usage

### Source to executable in one step

```
./ada83 --native program.ada -o program
./program
./ada83 --native main.ada library.ll -o main   # extra .ll modules are
                                               # linked in-process
```

`--native` runs the full pipeline in-process: the emitted IR is parsed,
optimized (`default<O2>`), and lowered to a host object file through
LLVM's C API, then linked into an executable by the first system C
compiler found (`$CC`, `cc`, `clang`, `gcc` — linking one object file is
the only step delegated, because lld has no stable C API and every
development machine has a `cc`). No intermediate files are left behind.

How the backend finds LLVM, in probe order:

1. `ADA83_LLVM_LIB` — explicit path to a libLLVM shared library.
2. **Windows**: a copy embedded in `ada83.exe` itself (see below), then
   `LLVM-C.dll` next to the executable.
3. The system library: `libLLVM.so` and its versioned sonames (LLVM 17+)
   on Linux, `libLLVM.dylib` from Homebrew or the Xcode Command Line
   Tools on macOS.

LLVM-C is a stable ABI, so the compiler declares the handful of entry
points it needs itself and `dlopen`s whatever major version the host has
— which is why none of this is needed at build time.

### Textual IR (the default)

```
./ada83 file.ada -o output.ll          # compile one file to LLVM IR
./ada83 file.ada                       # IR to stdout
./ada83 a.ada b.ada c.ada              # parallel compile (multi-file)
./ada83 -I /extra/path file.ada        # add include search path
./ada83 -g file.ada                    # annotate IR with emitter source sites
```

The textual pipeline is `.ada` → `.ll` → link → execute, using external
LLVM tools if you have them:

```
lli program.ll                                        # interpret / JIT
llc program.ll -o program.s && cc program.s -lm -lpthread -o program
llvm-link -o all.bc program.ll rts/report.ll && lli all.bc   # extra .ll libs
```

### Include path auto-discovery

WITH'd units are located and compiled automatically — no `-I` needed for
the common case. Search order: explicit `-I` paths, then `<exe_dir>/rts`
(the runtime library, resolved relative to the `ada83` binary), the input
file's directory, and `.`.

## Platform notes

### Windows

`make` under MSYS2 produces a fully standalone `ada83.exe`: the
repository vendors upstream MSYS2's libLLVM — unmodified, recompressed
alone so only the one required file is carried (provenance and checksum
in `tools/win64/README.md`) — and the build decompresses and embeds it
as a binary blob automatically. On first `--native` use the blob is
extracted once — size-tagged, atomically — into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ada83`
and loaded from there. (Extract-and-load is deliberate: manually mapping
a DLL from memory bypasses the Windows loader's TLS, dependency, and
unwind handling.) Shipping `LLVM-C.dll` next to `ada83.exe` also works —
`LoadLibrary` searches the executable's directory first.

Native links of *emitted programs* need `Synchronization.lib` — the
specialized rendezvous wait parks on `WaitOnAddress`/`WakeByAddressAll`.
This is automatic everywhere it can be: `--native` passes it to the
link itself, and MSVC-style linkers (lld-link, link.exe) honor the
`/DEFAULTLIB` directive embedded in the emitted IR. Only a manual MinGW
GNU ld link needs the explicit `-lsynchronization` (GNU ld ignores the
embedded directive). `lli` needs nothing — the symbols
resolve from kernelbase in-process. The rest of the runtime rides
winpthreads (MSYS2/MinGW).

### macOS

`--native` uses the Homebrew or Xcode Command Line Tools libLLVM
(probed automatically); the final link uses the system `cc`, which every
Mac with CLT has.

### Linux

`make` provisions libLLVM through the distribution's package manager if
missing. Everything else is stock: `cc`, `libm`, `libpthread`.

## The tasking runtime

Programs with tasks get a rendezvous runtime emitted into the module
(`linkonce_odr`, so multi-module links merge cleanly). It is dispatched
at compiler build time for the build host, like the SIMD fast paths:

- **Linux x86-64 / AArch64**: a completion wait spins briefly — PAUSE /
  YIELD between probes — then parks on a private futex keyed to the
  rendezvous record's own completion word; completion wakes exactly that
  waiter.
- **Windows x86-64 / AArch64**: the same spin phase, parking via
  `WaitOnAddress` / `WakeByAddressAll`.
- **Every other host**: a portable pthreads mutex/condvar path with
  identical semantics.

## Testing

Run the ACATS (Ada Compiler Validation Capability) conformance suite:

```
bash run_acats.sh g a       # class A (acceptance) tests
bash run_acats.sh g b       # class B (illegality) tests
bash run_acats.sh g c       # class C (executable) tests
bash run_acats.sh q c32     # just group c32
bash run_acats.sh f         # full suite (all classes)
NPROC=4 bash run_acats.sh f # limit parallelism
```

The harness executes tests under `lli`, so it needs external LLVM tools:
`lli`, `llvm-link`, and **`bash`**, GNU **`xargs`**, **`timeout`**,
**`bc`**, **`nproc`** plus standard POSIX utilities. On Debian/Ubuntu:
`apt install llvm`; on macOS: `brew install llvm coreutils findutils bc`
(and put `$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin` on `PATH`).

### ACATS delay deviation (temporary, development only)

The ACATS sources under `acats/` are modified from pristine: every `DELAY`
literal >= 1.0 seconds (and the named delay constants `WAIT_TIME` /
`DELAY_TIME` and `c96001a`'s delay variables) is **scaled down by 10x**
(`DELAY 5.0` -> `DELAY 0.5`). Each modified line is marked with

```
-- TODO: acats-delay-deviation: before was <original>
```

Rationale: the delay values are 1980s-era scheduling-margin padding; the
semantics they exercise (delay accuracy, master-wait ordering, timed-call
expiry) are preserved at 10x smaller margins on modern hardware, and the
full Class C run drops from ~5 minutes back to under a minute. The harness
cap (`TEST_TIMEOUT` in `run_acats.sh`, default 15 s) is sized to match.

**Before any conformance claim**: revert the deviation (grep for
`acats-delay-deviation`, restore the recorded values) and raise
`TEST_TIMEOUT` back to 120.
