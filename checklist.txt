Ada83 Compiler - ACATS C-Series Test Checklist
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Last updated: 2026-01-28
Target: All c-series tests passing without shortcuts

CRITICAL ISSUES (blocking many tests)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[ ] 1. USE clause visibility for generic package instances
      Tests: c23006d, c23006e, c23006f, c23006g
      Error: "numeric operands required for +"
      Root: USE pkg_instance makes pkg_instance.A visible, but A's type
            (INTEGER from generic template) not recognized as numeric
      Fix: When resolving USE'd generic instance exports, ensure their
           types are properly connected to the base type hierarchy

[ ] 2. Mixed-mode arithmetic: INTEGER * universal_real
      Tests: c35a04a, c35a04b, c35a04c, c35a04d
      Error: "type mismatch in assignment"
      Root: IDENT_INT(1) * SMALL where SMALL is named number (0.25)
            Result type should be universal_real, convertible to fixed
      Fix: Universal_real arithmetic must produce universal_real result
           that implicitly converts to the target fixed-point type

[ ] 3. Untyped aggregate in context requiring type
      Tests: c34009d, c34009f, c34009j, c34009l, c32001e, c35a05n
      Error: "untyped aggregate" or aggregate type not propagated
      Root: Aggregate in expression context without expected type
      Fix: Propagate expected type from assignment/parameter context

[ ] 4. Unsupported expression forms
      Tests: c25003a, c32001b, c32117a
      Error: "unsupported expression"
      Root: Certain expression forms not implemented in codegen
      Fix: Identify and implement missing expression forms

[ ] 5. Undefined identifier in derived type context
      Tests: c34008a, c34012a
      Error: "undefined identifier"
      Root: Derived type operations not properly inheriting
      Fix: Ensure derived types inherit primitive operations

SEMANTIC ISSUES (correct parse, wrong behavior)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[ ] 6. 'MANTISSA attribute returning wrong value (52 vs expected)
      Tests: c35a03a through c35a03q
      Actual: Returns 52 (double mantissa bits)
      Expected: Per Ada RM, smallest M such that (2**M - 1) * SMALL >= LARGE
      Fix: Compute MANTISSA from DELTA/RANGE, not IEEE 754 double

[ ] 7. 'FORE attribute returning 0
      Tests: c35a05a, c35a05d
      Root: Not computing decimal digits before point from range
      Fix: FORE = 1 + floor(log10(max(|bound|))) for fixed-point

[ ] 8. Discriminant default initialization incorrect
      Tests: c32001a (D1 not initialized), c32001c, c32001d
      Root: Default values from discriminant_specification not used
      Fix: Apply default expressions when allocating discriminated records

[ ] 9. Constraint_Error not raised for out-of-range values
      Tests: c32112a, c32112b, c32114a, c34011b
      Root: Missing constraint checking on assignment/conversion
      Fix: Generate constraint checks that raise CONSTRAINT_ERROR

[ ] 10. Incompatible types in fixed-point operations
       Tests: c35a06n through c35a06s, c35a07a, c35a07n through c35a07p
       Error: "incompatible types"
       Root: Fixed-point type compatibility rules too strict
       Fix: Allow operations between related fixed-point types

RUNTIME/LINKING ISSUES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[ ] 11. Unresolved symbols at link time
       Tests: c23006b, c24106a, c24203b, c24207a, many c34xxx tests
       Root: Missing runtime functions or incorrect mangling
       Fix: Audit RTS for missing functions, verify name mangling

[ ] 12. Runtime timeout (exit 124)
       Tests: c32107a
       Root: Infinite loop or very slow execution
       Fix: Debug and optimize hot paths

PROGRESS TRACKING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Tests baseline (sample):
  c23: 3/8 pass (37%)
  c24: 8/11 pass (72%)
  c25: 3/4 pass (75%)
  c26: 3/3 pass (100%)
  c32: 3/19 pass (15%)
  c34: 0/67 pass (0%)
  c35: 20/120 pass (16%)

Current focus: Issues 1, 2 (blocking many tests)
