ACATS c32 Group - Full Pass Checklist
======================================

Prompt: "In the pursuit of high-quality code (low line count and high
feature/correctness) - refactor and fix ada83.c to pass a single C-test group
completely with much better Haskell-like C99 and tight smart code-golfing with
'Literate Programming' style."

Target: c32 group (19 tests) - 100% pass rate

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Test Failures Fixed
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[x] c32113a (COMPILE/SKIP)
    Root cause: Private type completion not propagated to constrained subtypes.
    Fix: When completing a private type, propagate updated fields to all
    constrained subtypes that reference it (low_bound, high_bound, size, etc.).

[x] c32107a (BIND/SKIP -> blocks B/C/F wrong ORDER_CHECK values)
    Root cause 1: Deferred constants lost symbol binding in codegen.
    Fix A: Preserve deferred constant symbol binding at elaboration.

    Root cause 2: Duplicate extern emission for deferred constants.
    Fix B: extern_emitted guard prevents double emission.

    Root cause 3: Fat pointer setup re-evaluated BOUND_EXPR without checking
    cached_temp, causing double evaluation of side-effectful bound expressions.
    Fix: Check cached_temp before Generate_Expression in fat ptr setup code.

    Root cause 4: Array subtype elaboration order (RM 3.6(5)) not enforced:
    index bounds must be evaluated before component subtype constraints.
    Fix C+D: Pre-evaluate index bounds and element type constraints at
    obj_decl_init, setting cached_temp for reuse downstream.

[x] c32001b (RUNTIME:exit 1)
    Root cause 1: Multi-name declarations (S1, S2 : T := E) shared Type_Info
    with cached_temps from first name, violating RM 3.2.1.
    Fix: Clear cached_temps at top of per-name loop (for i > 0).

    Root cause 2: Stale BOUND_EXPR after declaration caused comparison
    aggregates to re-evaluate F(I), triggering CONSTRAINT_ERROR.
    Fix: Clear cached_temps after entire declaration; add stale-bounds
    guards in both dynamic and static aggregate constraint check paths.

    Root cause 3: Array-of-array element type index bounds not cached
    during subtype elaboration (RM 3.6(5) Step 2).  Inner aggregates
    re-evaluated F(3) per outer OTHERS iteration instead of once.
    Fix: Add array element type index bound caching in subtype
    elaboration, alongside existing record and scalar element handling.
