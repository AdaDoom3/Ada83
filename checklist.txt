CHECKLIST — Ada83.c Refactor for c43 ACATS Test Group
=====================================================

ORIGINAL PROMPT:
In the pursuit of high-quality code (low line count (e.g. low undue complexity) and high
feature/correctness) - refactor and fix ada83.c to pass a single C-test group completely
(e.g. cXX) with much better Haskell-like C99 and tight smart code-golfing with, ironically,
textbook "Literate Programming" style.

Do NOT skip around - when you encounter a complex problem look at it as an opportunity to
finally attack a big problem.

Create a file to track everything called "checklist.txt" and include this prompt in it.
Start with c43. Test exclusively with run_acats.sh

TARGET: c43 (53 tests — aggregates, allocators, constraint checks)
TEST COMMAND: bash run_acats.sh q c43
