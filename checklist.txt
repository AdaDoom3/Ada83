Ada83 Compiler — ACATS C-Series Progress Checklist
====================================================

Compiler: ada83.c (~22,500 lines, single-file Ada 83 → LLVM IR)
Target:   ACATS c-series tests (ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A conformance)
Branch:   claude/refactor-ada83-c-4BhEc

=== COMPLETED FIXES ===

Batch 1 (commit df805ca):
  [x] NOT IN range parser — was only parsing single value, not range
  [x] IN/NOT IN codegen — runtime bounds check generation
  [x] Character literal in selected component — Resolve_Selected
  [x] Type widening for small enum/integer — i8→i64 in Generate_Apply
  [x] IN/NOT IN with subtypes — proper bounds extraction
  [x] Generic instantiation frame_base — Has_Nested_Subprograms

Batch 2 (commit 0a257df):
  [x] Generic formal type registration — def_kind mapping in proc/func bodies
  [x] Type_Covers same-name matching for FLOAT/FIXED types
  [x] Comparison enum literal disambiguation — Symbol_Find_By_Type re-resolution
  [x] Qualified expression i64 widening — Emit_Convert to i64 after type convert
  [x] Qualified expression enum/char resolution — contextual re-resolution

Batch 3 (commit 1b8a821):
  [x] Operator_Name bare names — removed quoting to match symbol table
  [x] Unary NOT boolean array type preservation — RM 4.5.6
  [x] Word-based operators in Resolve_Apply — NOT/ABS/AND/OR/XOR/MOD/REM

=== IN PROGRESS ===

Batch 4:
  [ ] Untyped aggregate type propagation in codegen (~98 tests affected)
  [ ] Undefined record component names C1/DISC (~31 tests)
  [ ] Type mismatch in assignment — mixed numeric (~19 tests)

=== REMAINING ERROR CATEGORIES (by impact) ===

=== NOTES ===

- Coding style: Haskell-like C99, tight code-golfing, Literate Programming
- Ada-like full names, sparse but thoughtful comments
- Reference: /home/user/Ada83/reference/gnat/ (GNAT LLVM source)
- Computation model: all scalars in i64 width; narrow only at store/param
- Test harness: bash test.sh q <group>
