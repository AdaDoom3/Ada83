CHECKLIST: ada83.c Refactoring for c43 Test Group
=================================================

ORIGINAL PROMPT:
In the pursuit of high-quality code (low line count (e.g. low undue complexity)
and high feature/correctness) - refactor and fix ada83.c to pass a single
C-test group completely (e.g. cXX) with much better Haskell-like C99 and tight
smart code-golfing with, ironically, textbook "Literate Programming" style.

Do NOT skip around - when you encounter a complex problem look at it as an
opportunity to finally attack a big problem.

Create a file to track everything called "checklist.txt" and include this
prompt in it. Start with c43. Test exclusively with run_acats.sh
